| Files | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `inter-{latin,latin-ext,cyrillic,cyrillic-ext}-wght-normal.woff2` | npm `@fontsource-variable/inter@5.3.0`, `files/` |
| `jetbrains-mono-{latin,latin-ext,cyrillic,cyrillic-ext}-wght-normal.woff2` | npm `@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono@5.3.0`, `files/` |

The packages are only the source of the files; they are not dependencies of `@jarvis/web`. The
`@font-face` rules live in `web/src/styles/fonts.css` (copied from the packages' `wght.css`, paths
rewritten to `/fonts/`).
